# mirror-operator
A python module + resulting docker image which listens for registry mirror requests and creates resources for that mirror. 
If you're confused what an operator is, [this blog post][operators] will give you a short introduction, but please note it's a little old.

## Configuration
The following environment variables can be set:

Name | description | default 
--- | --- | --- 
NAMESPACE | The namespace in which the resources should be created. This should be the same namespace as where the container is running | default 
SECONDS_BETWEEN_STREAMS | Time to sleep between calls to the API. The operator will occasionally lose connection or else fail to run if the Custom Resource Definition does not exist. | 30

## Usage
In order to have the operator deploy a new mirror, the cluster needs to have the custom resource defined:
```
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  # name must match the spec fields below, and be in the form: <plural>.<group>
  name: registrymirrors.k8s.osp.tech
spec:
  # group name to use for REST API: /apis/<group>/<version>
  group: k8s.osp.tech
  # version name to use for REST API: /apis/<group>/<version>
  version: v1
  # either Namespaced or Cluster
  scope: Cluster
  names:
    # plural name to be used in the URL: /apis/<group>/<version>/<plural>
    plural: registrymirrors
    # singular name to be used as an alias on the CLI and for display
    singular: registrymirror
    # kind is normally the CamelCased singular type. Your resource manifests use this.
    kind: RegistryMirror
    # shortNames allow shorter string to match your resource on the CLI
    shortNames:
    - rm

```

You can then create new mirrors by providing at minimum an `upstreamUrl` in the spec:
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.osp.tech/v1
kind: RegistryMirror
metadata:
  name: docker
spec:
  upstreamUrl: hub.docker.io
```

If you have a username/password which must be used to access the upstream mirror, you can add a `credentialsSecret` key to the spec, who's value should
be the name of the secret, e.g:
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.osp.tech/v1
kind: RegistryMirror
metadata:
  name: internal
spec:
  upstreamUrl: hub.docker.io
  credentialsSecret: internal-mirror
```

The operator will then deploy a daemon set, stateful set, service and headless service in whichever namespace is configured. We generally expect this to be default. These will all be named `registry-mirror-<name>`, with the exception of the headless service which will be named `registry-mirror-<name>-headless`.
You can get all the elements of your mirror using - `kubectl get ds,statefulset,svc,registrymirror -l mirror=<name> -n default`.

If you wish to update the secret or URL, all you need to do is change it in the `RegistryMirror` manifest and the operator will handle updates.
